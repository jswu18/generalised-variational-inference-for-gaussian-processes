# Gaussian Wasserstein Inference in Function Spaces

Leveraging Generalised Variational Inference (GVI) to build a loss objective with the Wasserstein distance for image classifier sparse Gaussian Processes constructed with NNGP infinite-width kernels.

For a quick overview of GVI, see <a href="https://jswu18.github.io/posts/2023/07/generalised-variational-inference/">my blog post</a>.

Gaussian Wasserstein Inference is developed in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06342.pdf">this paper</a> by Veit Wild.
